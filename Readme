System Engineering Concept Phase Process

Overview:

This repository hosts a comprehensive process model for the concept phase of system engineering, meticulously crafted in accordance 
with the International Council on Systems Engineering (INCOSE) handbook. The concept phase is a critical stage in the system engineering lifecycle, 
laying the foundation for successful project outcomes.

Key Features:
INCOSE Compliant: The process model strictly adheres to the guidelines outlined in the INCOSE handbook, ensuring industry-standard practices and methodologies.

Cross-Directional Visualization: Utilizing Visio, the process is visually represented in a cross-directional manner, providing a holistic view of the concept phase. 
This aids in better understanding and communication among project stakeholders.

Modularity and Flexibility: The process is designed to be modular and flexible, accommodating various project requirements and contexts. This adaptability 
makes it suitable for a wide range of system engineering projects.

Documentation and Guidelines: In addition to the visual representation, the repository includes comprehensive documentation and guidelines for each step of 
the concept phase. This documentation serves as a valuable resource for project teams and individuals seeking to understand or implement the process.
